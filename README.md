# [RedHat SAP Community Project](https://redhat-sap.github.io)

In the github repository you will find community projects and demos around SAP and its products.
The projects intend enhancing experience with SAP software on Red Hat products, help to create customer demos and much more.

You can install the roles from [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/redhat_sap)
